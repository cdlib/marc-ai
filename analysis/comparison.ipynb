Confidence values near this threshold are not highly certain but are considered more likely than not to be matches or mismatches, depending on which side they fall. Confidence scores closer to 50% typically correspond to more ambiguous similarities in the comparisons, such as the same government report for different states or different cataloging choices for the same item. These scores are more prone to false positives and false negatives. For instance, a model confidence score of 60% can be interpreted as the model predicting a match 60% of the time and a mismatch 40% of the time.\n",

    "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is commonly used in comparisons. This is an curve that plots the rate of false positives on the x-axis, and the rate of true positives is on the y-axis. Ideally, you want the line to hug the y-axis till it hits the top of the chart. The means the method is having good success in finding all the true positives without introducing many false positives. The curved corner of the data indicates the false positive rate increases when trying to identity last 5% of true positives (e.g. the ambiguous cases). Sometimes it requires zooming in to better see the differences between the cures. \n",

Precision and recall are commonly used metrics for evaluating search performance. Precision calculates the percentage of retrieved items that are actually relevant, while recall metrics the proportion of relevant items in the entire document collection that are retrieved. In this context, recall indicates how many real matches were identified as matches, and precision demonstrates how many items identified as matches were indeed real matches.\n",

For instance, for every prediction with a confidence score between 0.5 and 0.6, a well-calibrated model would have 50% to 60% matches and 50% to 40% mismatches. To be calibrated, the model should have slightly more matches than mismatches within the 50% to 60% range. The gray line represents perfect calibration.\n",

    "The solid lines on the plot represent the models, with the shaded area around each line indicating the level of uncertainty in the accuracy estimates given the available data. A better-calibrated model will have a plotted line closer to the diagonal gray line. Due to the relatively few confidence scores between 1% and 99%, there is increased uncertainty about where the calibration line would be with a larger dataset.\n",

When the performance of the models is quite similar, it may be necessary to employ additional methods to determine if the observed differences are significant or merely due to random variations in the test dataset. It's also worth noting that different test sets might reveal disparities in model performance depending on the dataset used for testing."
